                            Hello! My name is Liz Abinante and I love to code, knit, and read. I'm currently living in Chicago but am a born-and-raised California girl at heart. Someday I'll move back to California or some other place where <a href="http://instagram.com/p/Vc3oulPGBq/">things like this</a> don't happen.

                            My non-technical super powers are freakishly fast hand raising, speed-reading, and selecting perfectly ripe fruits and vegetables. I am also great at working with and leading teams, DIY crafts, thinking about concepts on both a micro and macro level, and braiding hair.

                            This is an in-progress side projects that I am absolutely smitten with. I developed a knitting pattern generator that creates hat patterns based on a user's input. I'm in the process of writing more tests, debugging, refactoring, and making it better. Is a project ever really finished?

                        I got my hacking chops at Dev Bootcamp in Chicago, where I was part of the second cohort.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to this high level of nerdiness, I also have a double Bachelor's in Psychology and Women's Studies (UC Davis) and a Master's in Women's Studies (San Francisco State University).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wrote my Master's thesis on vampires, it's got a great title: <em>Bite Me, I'm Yours: Vampire Romance, Female Readership, and Negotiating Ideology</em>. Before starting my journey at Dev Bootcamp, my thesis was my proudest accomplishment. If you ask me about it I will talk your ear off about vampires for 2+ hours and offer to send you a copy to read. Just a warning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've been a nanny, a copy writer, a beta tester, an editor, a waitress, a teacher, and a business owner. While these disparate jobs may sound like the career path of an indecisive person, everything circles back to my love of hacking, knitting, and reading.
