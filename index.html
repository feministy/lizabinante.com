					<h1>Liz Abinante</h1>
          <h3>full stack developer. knitter. sassy lady.</h3>
          <p>
            Hello! My name is Liz Abinante and I love to code, knit, and read. I love Ruby and being a part of the development community.
          </p>
          <p>
          	I'm currently living in Chicago but am a born-and-raised California girl at heart. Someday I'll move back to California or some other place where <a href="http://instagram.com/p/Vc3oulPGBq/">things like this</a> don't happen.
          </p>
          <h3>my super powers</h3>
          <p>
          	Courtesy of <a href="http://devbootcamp.com">DevBootcamp</a>:
          	<ul>
          		<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
          		<li>JavaScript and jQuery</li>
          		<li>Sinatra</li>
          		<li>RSpec and BDD</li>
          		<li>Product management</li>
          		<li>Version control with Git</li>
          		<li>Database modeling</li>
          		<li>Object-oriented programming</li>
          	</ul>

          	From my formative nerdy years:
          	<ul>
          		<li>HTML5</li>
          		<li>CSS3</li>
          		<li>WordPress</li>
          		<li>Typography</li>
          	</ul>
          </p>
          <h3>my non-technical super powers</h3>
          <p>
            My non-technical super powers are freakishly fast hand raising, speed-reading, and selecting perfectly ripe fruits and vegetables. I am also great at working with and leading teams, DIY crafts, thinking about concepts on both a micro and macro level, and braiding hair.
          </p>
          <h1>Pet Projects</h1>
          <h3>lovekn.it</h3>
          <p>
          	This is one of my in-progress side projects that I am absolutely smitten with. I developed a knitting pattern generator that creates patterns based on a user's input. It's still in the refactoring stages, but I'm so in love with it that I can't help but share.

          <h3>Star Wars Mad Libs</h3>
          <p>
          	I was struggling with Object-Oriented principles in JavaScript and one of my instructors challenged me to build a <i>Star Wars</i> crawler. So I did!

          <h3>Self Esteem Generator</h3>
          <p>
          	I made this during my first week of DevBootcamp before I knew anything about Object-Oriented programming. The world's smallest command line app for boosting your self esteem. Having a rough day? Boot it up and instantly feel better.

					<h3>education</h3>
					<p>
						I got my hacking chops at Dev Bootcamp in Chicago, where I was part of the second cohort that finished in July 2013.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to this high level of nerdiness, I also have a double Bachelor's in Psychology and Women's Studies (UC Davis) and a Master's in Women's Studies (San Francisco State University).
					</p>
					<p>
					 I wrote my Master's thesis on vampires, it's got a great title: <em>Bite Me, I'm Yours: Vampire Romance, Female Readership, and Negotiating Ideology</em>. Before starting my journey at Dev Bootcamp, my thesis was my proudest accomplishment. If you ask me about it I will talk your ear off about vampires for 2+ hours and offer to send you a copy to read. Just a warning.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've been a nanny, a copy writer, a beta tester, an editor, a waitress, a teacher, and a business owner. While these disparate jobs may sound like the career path of an indecisive person, everything circles back to my love of hacking, knitting, and reading.
