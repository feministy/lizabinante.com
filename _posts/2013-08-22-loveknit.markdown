When I went to Dev Bootcamp, it was my goal that I could build a knitting pattern generator. It started out as a command line app, and then I made it with Sinatra. Now ported over to Rails, lovekn.it is a knitting pattern generator. Users can create accounts and save their custom generated patterns. Currently, the project creates hat patterns only. It provides step-by-step instructions for knitting, along with yardage estimates for the final project and row-by-row stitch counts.
