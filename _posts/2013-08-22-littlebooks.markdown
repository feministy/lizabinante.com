Little Books was inspired by an NPR story, which discusses the importance and lack of diversity in children's books. The goal of Little Books is to help parents, teachers, and educators enrich the lives of children by modifying beloved stories to feature diverse characters.

Little Books was a final project for Dev Bootcamp created by Liz Abinante, Bill Van Der Laan, and Nestor Castillo.
