        <p>I am here because I love what I do. I love working with Ruby. I love tinkering with JavaScript. I get an absolute thrill over the legitimately amazing things I can do with programming. I&#39;m stoked to learn Clojure. And maybe Scala. Or Python? More things. I&#39;m excited to learn more.</p>

        <p>People in the development community tend to throw around the phrase &quot;soft skills&quot; to describe things that are not directly related to writing code. This isn&#39;t exclusive to the development world; lots of people use the term &quot;soft skills&quot; to describe traits that can&#39;t be directly attributed to certifiable/measurable skills and specialities. A non-exhaustive list of what &quot;soft skills&quot; typically encompasses would be:</p>

        <p>It’s no secret or a surprise that knitting is a gendered hobby. Most knitters are women and there is nothing offensive or factually incorrect about that statement. While knitting as a hobby is growing and there are more men and boys participating in the craft, it is still primarily women that pick up the needles and work with yarn.</p>

        <p>This has been the start of my first week as a Software Engineer. I work at a real company doing things with code that people actually use. It is awesome, terrifying, thrilling, challenging, and hands down the coolest thing I’ve ever done. I’ve only been poking around in the code base for a few hours a day, but I’ve come to realize that I am going to learn more at this job than I expected.</p>

        <p>Since graduating college, I’ve only had one job that required &quot;business casual&quot; attire. I hated that job, partly because a dead-set-in-her-traditional-ways HR representative made snide comments about my wardrobe everyday (&quot;I wish I wasn’t a professional woman so I could wear jeans!&quot;). It was never &quot;business casual&quot; enough for her.</p>

        <p>One of my favorite ways to explain how passionate I am about coding is to compare it to the world of Harry Potter. To me, learning to code is the closest I will ever get to boarding the train to Hogwarts, taking my O.W.Ls, and crushing my N.E.W.Ts. Picking out a new computer and configuring Vim (new obsession) are akin to selecting a wand at Olivander&rsquo;s. I could continue with the comparisons, but I think you get it.<br><br></p>

        <p>A lot of the time when I describe myself and what I&#39;m passionate about, I end up talking about <em>women in programming</em> or <em>women in engineering</em>. Taking about concepts such as power, oppression, injustice, equality, objectification, etc has been a common theme in my life since I started college.<br><br></p>

        <p>Phase 3 feels so much more&nbsp;<em>real</em> to me than phases 1 and 2. We&#39;re working on our first multi-day project, which requires a lot more cooperation than something that only takes a day to build. I loved phases 1 and 2, but phase 3 feels real. It feels more like a work environment and I&nbsp;<em>love it so much</em>. We&#39;re planning in detail, communicating, sharing the work load, and reviewing each others code. It feels so natural and my team and I have gotten into a really good flow.<br><br></p>

        <p>I spent a lot of time in phase 2 on an emotional roller coaster. I felt like a winner, a loser, a spaz, an imposter, a slacker, a bad ass, and a crazy person on a daily basis. Cycling through such intense emotions was exhausting. Was? Is. Still happening.<br><br></p>
