  <p>The new cohort arrived on Monday. It&#39;s all dudes. <span>I know that the dbc staff are trying as hard as they can to encourage diversity in the field and within the program. I also know that several factors out of their control contributed to the population of the new cohort (the Otters), but it&#39;s still frustrating. My learning environment completely changed on Monday with the addition of 16 <em>dudes</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><br></p>

<p>I went from being 1 of 3 women in a room of ~40 men to 1 of 5 women (two new female instructors!!!!!!! <em>not enough exclamation points in the world</em>) in a room of ~60 men. It&#39;s like studying in a frat house full of competitive nerds.<br><br></p>

<p>One great thing is that there are now even more people around me that I can help learn. I love teaching and explaining things. It&#39;s one of the big reasons I feel like I&#39;m doing so well at dbc. Once I understand something, I can help someone else understand it also, which strengthens my ability to use it.<br><br></p>

<p>The addition of more people into this space - male or not - always changes the environment. The people already there are not immune to the changes. This became obvious to me when I offered to help some fellow students this week.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>This week when I offered help to two other students working on a complex regexp and&nbsp;</strong><strong>called myself a regex wizard</strong><strong>, a 3 minute debate ensued over whether or not I <span><em>can</em></span> call myself a wizard, or if I should call myself a witch.</strong><br><br></p>

<p>First: I&nbsp;<span><em>can</em></span> call myself whatever I want. It is 2013.<br><br></p>

<p>Second: really, guys? That&#39;s where you went with it when I offered help? Gendered semantics and &quot;that&#39;s not how they do it in&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter&quot;</em>&nbsp;instead of taking my offer seriously? I know they&#39;ll take it seriously someday, and that asking for and receiving help are skills that not everyone has immediately... but&nbsp;<em>wow</em>.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

<p>The big problem is that <strong>not everyone has learned to value diverse voices.&nbsp;</strong>You learn that at dbc, but it takes some time, and if they don&#39;t, they will be the ones missing out on the amazing wealth of knowledge that the folks here&ndash;students included&ndash;can provide.<br><br></p>

<p>Phase 2 started for me on Monday, and we jumped right into jQuery, AJAX, and Sinatra. It was a really overwhelming first day, not unlike our first day of phase 1. The main difference between day 1 of phase 1 and day 1 of phase 2 is really the amount of knowledge I have on the subject.<br><br></p>

<p>Before phase 1 started, I spent about 2 months learning Ruby basics and going over the prep work they sent to me.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

<p>Before phase 2 started, I spent a weekend cramming as much information as I could into my brain.<br><br></p>

<p>Turns out you can&#39;t learn as much in a weekend as you can in two months. Are you surprised? I&#39;m not, but I was still shocked to find myself back in a panic zone of &quot;<strong>OMG I DON&#39;T KNOW ANYTHING OMG THIS IS AWFUL OMG OMG WHY AM I DOING THIS?!</strong>&quot;&nbsp;<br><br></p>

<p>I sat down Monday night, took a deep breath, and remembered that&nbsp;<strong>I&#39;m not an expert</strong>. I&#39;ll never be an expert. I&#39;ll have a strong understanding, but I&#39;ll always be learning new things about the stuff I know. I&#39;m not here to try and become an expert, I&#39;m here to develop a solid foundation that will help me on my road to becoming a developer.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

<p>jQuery itself is not hard, and the concept of AJAX is not difficult, either. Combining the two and introducing Sinatra was&nbsp;<em>a lot</em> at once. In a good way. If I had learned them separately, it wouldn&#39;t be as interesting or motivating. It also would not have been as rewarding because I wouldn&#39;t have been able to compile such vibrant products right out of the gate. We built a Craigslist Junior yesterday!&nbsp;<br><br></p>

<p>I am fortunate in that I have a strong background in CSS and HTML, so I am not struggling with those concepts and can spend less time learning about them. I am still learning new techniques and ways to manipulate my content, but it is not my main priority.<br><br></p>
