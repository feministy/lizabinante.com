  On being new
</h1>

<div class="post">
  <p>Last week I had the pleasure of having lunch at Table XI and taking part in their round table talk for the day, where I gave a Pecha Kucha presentation on what it meant for me to experience being new.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

<p>Dev Bootcamp offers an optional phase 4, where students stay around for an extra 3 weeks and offer 10 hours of TA work in exchange for additional training on a Javascript framework. They also get help searching for jobs and everything that comes with job hunting. I opted not to do phase 4 through Dev Bootcamp and am instead doing my own personal phase 4.<br><br></p>

<p>A lot of people have asked me why I&#39;m not doing phase 4. When presented with the opportunity to learn for 3 more weeks and know more than I do now, I jumped at the opportunity. But the more I thought about&nbsp;<em>why</em> I was doing phase 4, the more I realized that I shouldn&#39;t.<br><br></p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t so excited about doing phase 4 because I wanted to learn more. I was excited to do phase 4 because I was terrified of leaving Dev Bootcamp and being on my own. While I&#39;m not on my own because I still have mentors and the Ruby community, I am significantly more alone than I have been in the last 9 weeks. I was using phase 4 as a crutch, as a way to avoid coming to terms with the gaps in my knowledge. I was scared that I would realize how little I knew, that I would find myself unprepared for an apprentice- or junior-level developer position.<br><br></p>

<p>The end result of all this pondering and thinking was that&nbsp;<strong>I couldn&#39;t do phase 4 just because I was scared of learning on my own</strong>. I had to opt out of phase 4 and face my fears. It was precisely&nbsp;<em>because</em> I was scared of not doing it that I had to do it.<br><br></p>

<p>So here I am, sitting on my couch, reading a book about RSpec for Rails, snacking on some fruit, and hammering away at the keyboard writing tests for my <a href="http://loveknit.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">knitting pattern generator</a>. I&#39;m editing my resume, tinkering with my <a href="http://www.lizabinante.com/" target="_blank">website</a>, and relaxing with my pup. It&#39;s not so scary after all. It&#39;s a little weird being alone after spending 12-15 hours a day with the same 20 or so people, but I&#39;m enjoying busting some dance moves in my living room.<br><br></p>

<p>It has been awhile since I&#39;ve felt&nbsp;<em>new</em>. I wasn&#39;t new at my last job for a long time. There&nbsp;wasn&rsquo;t much about my position that I&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t know or understand. Before that, I was a nanny and a grad student. Being new is foreign to me now.<br><br></p>

<p>I was trying to describe the sensation of being new to programming to someone, and the best analogy I could come up with was that it felt like I was being shot out of a cannon. Being propelled through the sky, soaring so fast and seeing things from a completely unique perspective. Trying to take everything in, but being so overwhelmed by my surroundings that I feel like I&#39;m missing things.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

<p>I know that my cannon-like existence won&#39;t last for long. I&#39;ll find a job soon-ish, and I&#39;ll get comfortable with being new. I will continue to learn and teach everyday. But until then, I&#39;m in my little cannon, propelling through the sky. Zoooooom!<br><br></p>
