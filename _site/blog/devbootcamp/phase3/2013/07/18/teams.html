  Teams, long(er)-term projects, and maintainable code

<div class="post">
  <p>Phase 3 feels so much more&nbsp;<em>real</em> to me than phases 1 and 2. We&#39;re working on our first multi-day project, which requires a lot more cooperation than something that only takes a day to build. I loved phases 1 and 2, but phase 3 feels real. It feels more like a work environment and I&nbsp;<em>love it so much</em>. We&#39;re planning in detail, communicating, sharing the work load, and reviewing each others code. It feels so natural and my team and I have gotten into a really good flow.<br><br></p>

<p>Me being me, I&#39;ve fallen into a natural product management role. I&#39;m assessing where we are in our sprint, where we should be, and any changes we need to make to get there. I spot road blocks and find the resources necessary to destroy them. I keep our stand ups short and on topic. I&#39;ve color coded our white board with models and associations, and I&#39;ve been handling our project tasks in Pivotal Tracker. I&#39;m dying - I love it.<br><br></p>

<p>Working on a project and continuing to work on a project makes me realize how important maintainable code is. Since I&#39;ve been at Dev Bootcamp, we code, deploy, and run. We move onto the next project and we don&#39;t really look back, unless we do it in our personal time.<br><br></p>

<p>Since we&#39;ve been learning Rails, I&#39;ve been working on porting over my knitting pattern generator from Sinatra. Some of the move has been relatively painless, but a few aspects have had me cursing my past self. A little bit for my lack of knowledge, and a little bit for being a hacky brat. It&#39;s going to take me awhile to port it over to Rails, and I&#39;m also working on incorporating more JavaScript, which is definitely slowing the process.&nbsp;<span>I&nbsp;</span><em>love</em><span> Rails. I love testing. I can&#39;t wait to wait tests for my knitting pattern generator.&nbsp;</span><br><br></p>

<p><span>I&#39;ve started sniffing around for jobs when I have a spare minute or two and thinking about the kind of company I want to look for, and&nbsp;</span>what kind of work I want to do. I&#39;ve also started thinking about projects for myself during my down time, and I&#39;ve settled on OO JavaScript, a front-end framework (likely Angular), and Jasmine. This is the first time in the last 7 weeks that I&#39;ve had time to think about my future in a serious way and what I want to do professionally, and what I want to learn.<br><br></p>

<p>I want to code. I want to manage. I want to teach. I want to mentor. I want to speak. I want to have fun.</p></p>
