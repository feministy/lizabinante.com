  Interviewing Women
</h1>

<div class="post">
  <p>One of the things I learned from the interview processes I went through is that the presence of women is important. I present you with two different scenarios.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>One</strong>: A large company&nbsp;with a number of well known and very talented female engineers and product managers on staff. The only women I spoke with during my entire interview process&nbsp;<em>fetched me water and coordinated guest pass access to the building</em>. I did not meet a single female employee who was not a recruiter. While they were all very lovely, kind women, I felt no connection to them because all I talked with them about was the weather. When I brought up the topic of female engineers in general, they started discussing a female product manager and how great she was.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>Two</strong>:&nbsp;A mid-size company with a number of female engineers, engineering managers, product managers, and technical support team members. I did not interview with any women, but I was introduced to many members of the engineering team during my visit, including a number of women. While I also felt no connection to them, it was due to the brevity of our interaction, not because of their role at the company.&nbsp;<span>When I brought up the topic of female engineers in general,</span><span>&nbsp;they said they had quite a few and appreciate the value of a diverse work force in all aspects.&nbsp;</span><br><br></p>

<p>Even though I spent less time talking to the women at Company Two, the interactions I had with them were more meaningful.&nbsp;<span>I don&#39;t need to talk to women, or see women, or even have any women there to want to work at a company.</span><br><br></p>

<p><strong><span>But when the only interaction I had with the women you employ is what equates to them running errands, there isn&#39;t a snowball&#39;s chance in hell that I will come to work for you.&nbsp;</span></strong><br><br></p>

<p><span>And it&#39;s not because you have female recruiters. That&#39;s not why. It&#39;s because I&#39;m passionate about diversity in engineering. It&#39;s one of the first things out of my mouth during every interview process. For a company to listen to me say that numerous times and create&nbsp;<em>that</em> interview experience says to me that they really don&#39;t care about me as an individual human being with interests outside of hacking. <strong>Or <em>much much&nbsp;worse</em>, that they don&#39;t care about diversity in engineering.&nbsp;</strong></span><br><br></p>

<p><span><em>(For what it&#39;s worth: you don&#39;t have to employ women engineers to care about diversity. You just have to genuinely, honestly care about diversity.)</em></span><br><br></p>
