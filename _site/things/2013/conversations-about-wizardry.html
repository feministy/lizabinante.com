  Conversations about wizardry, gender, and diversity

<div class="post">
  <p>Earlier this week, I ran into a <a href="http://feministy.tumblr.com/post/52217646242/web-development-and-more-ruby-newbies" target="_blank">brick wall of sexism</a>. What happened after that was infinitely more interesting than the event itself.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

<p>Fellow boot and member of the cohort below me, <a href="https://twitter.com/iericallen" target="_blank">Eric</a>&nbsp;spoke to me during our lunch hour:<br><br></p>

<p><em>
What can I do to help make this cohort better?&nbsp;
</em><br><Br></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/elliottgarms" target="_blank">Elliott</a>, Dev Bootcamp&#39;s in house recruiter:<br><br></p>

<p><em>
What you did was great. I want us to have conversations like that openly so we can make dbc and the field better. If you have any ideas, I want to hear them.
</em><br><br></p>

<p>Lots of other great things happened on Twitter, too.<br><br></p>

<p>People&nbsp;<em>agreed</em> with me strongly enough to share my message. This blew my mind:<br><br></p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/993db853a3422fff0586ad6c60aeda05/tumblr_inline_mo0x6328GH1qz4rgp.png" /><br><br></p>

<p>A mountain of support came in from people I had never spoken to before:<br><br></p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/5afde2ec3335123681075e053318528a/tumblr_inline_mo0x6uqFyy1qz4rgp.png" /><br><br></p>

<p>And leaders in the field not only sympathizing, but working to make change happen where they can, too:<br><br></p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/420d51496a2a6e568a176252fc557980/tumblr_inline_mo0x9id71U1qz4rgp.png" /><br><br></p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/d37fca3f91756c6e66c92beb44aee562/tumblr_inline_mo0x9qKgDj1qz4rgp.png" /><br><br></p>

<p>One of my wonderful mentors embracing the joy of learning:<br><br></p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/c9fa6fa12e860302c017e9ab5de978d8/tumblr_inline_mo0x7wPcao1qz4rgp.png" /><br><br></p>

<p>And more support from dbc staff:<br><br></p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/459f0220556d7336ad3493653ed7acf7/tumblr_inline_mo0x7hfO7l1qz4rgp.png" /><br><br></p>

<p>Out of all the responses I received, and all of the support that was offered, the best thing came from <a href="https://twitter.com/davehoover" target="_blank">Dave</a>, our illustrious Chicago dbc co-founder. He didn&#39;t want answers, he didn&#39;t want an explanation. He just wanted to open up the option to talk. Not just about the wizard/witch comment, but about me, dbc, and how I felt about all of the things.<br><br></p>

<p><em>
I want to check in with you. Lets talk.&nbsp;
</em><br><Br></p>

<p>The most important thing to come out of this was the support I received from all fronts. The support from Dev Bootcamp has&nbsp;<em>always</em> been there, even before this happened, and they were still there when I said things that could have been interpreted as making them look bad. They understood it as a conversation that this field needs to have and embraced the dialogue.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

<p><strong>One last note about diversity in software development: it&#39;s not just about men, women, and gender equity in the field.&nbsp;</strong>It&#39;s about diversity, period, not just gender. We can&#39;t forget that everyone has different privileges and oppressions in their lives. While I may be a minority because I&#39;m a woman, I&#39;m also white and heterosexual. We need to steer the conversation away from &quot;how do we get more women into programming?&quot; and toward &quot;how do we get more women into programming and grow the diversity of the field?&quot;<br><br></p>
