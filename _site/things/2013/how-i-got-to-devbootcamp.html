  How I got to DevBootcamp: the making of a sassy lady nerd
</h1>

<div class="post">
  <p>A lot of things in my life happened that resulted in me attending DevBootcamp, but I think it can be boiled down to a few things:<br><br></p>

<ul>
<li>My parents</li>
<li>My love of books and computers (see Thing #1)</li>
<li>NSync</li>
</ul>

<p>Like most folks in my generation, I grew up with parents telling me I could be or do whatever I wanted and praising me for my successes and strengths. Fortunately, they also recognized my weaknesses and didn&#39;t force me to continue with team sports beyond my obligatory year on a soccer team. They let me fail and succeed at a pace that was comfortable for me. Turns out I hate failing, which may have been a big reason why it took me so long to figure out what I wanted to do.<br><br></p>

<p>I was really lucky to have computer classes in elementary school. I would rush to finish my assignments early so that I could play Oregon Trail. I loved computers from the moment I sat down at one with the green-on-black DOS screen.<br><br></p>

<p>I was kind of dorky when I was a kid (still dorky now!). I read a ton of books - it was actually a financial pain point for my parents that I would finish a brand new book so quickly. Our weekly library trips on Friday quickly became my favorite thing - I&#39;m pretty sure I hurt some friends&#39; feelings when I rejected their offer to hang out and went to the library instead. Much to my dismay, my junior library card only let me checkout 3 books at a time (WHY?!), so I made my parents get me more books each week. I was by no means a scholar: I read mostly Babysitters Club, Boxcar Kids, Nancy Drew (still some of my favorite books to this day), and other YA staples. I dabbled in some Charles Dickens when I was a bit older. I was big on escaping into whatever I was reading, so there was lots of fantasy, fairy tales, and time travel.<br><br></p>

<p>I went to a really small junior high school: it was kindergarten through 8th grade, so there were only about 120 kids in 7th and 8th grade total. I had a few really close friends, but didn&#39;t really get along with very many of the kids. They all played&nbsp;<em>sports</em>, heaven forbid. As a result, I wasn&#39;t particularly social and I spent a lot of time in chat rooms. Remember chat rooms? Oh yeah.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

<p>My time in chat rooms led me to want to learn how to make websites. I taught myself HTML and CSS (mostly just the blink tag) and I made my first website on gURLpages, dedicated to my&nbsp;<em>favorite band ever</em>&nbsp;(at the time) NSync.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>I think that&#39;s how I ended up at DevBootcamp. That moment when I was 12 years old and I looked at a website and thought to myself &quot;I could do this.&quot; And then I did it.&nbsp;</strong><br><br></p>

<p>It&#39;s not really that impressive. HTML and CSS were entirely different beasts back then, and there was much less to learn. Designing websites became a hobby and passion of mine, and eventually I went on to found my own business online selling hand dyed yarn and knitting patterns. To this day one of my favorite things to do is tinker with fonts and color schemes, especially now that flat UIs are so trendy (I love the clean look).<br><br></p>

<p>Somehow, even though I loved computers and designing websites, I never thought it could be something that I would make a career out of. My dad, bless him, pushed me to take programming classes. I never did take classes (until now), but he didn&#39;t stop encouraging me, and now he can say his daughter is a programmer. I always thought I would be a teacher of some sort, and I got my degrees in Women&#39;s Studies with the goal that I would move onto being a college professor. I loved teaching and studying, but it didn&#39;t feel right. I finished grad school and started working at Groupon, where I stayed stagnant for two years while I tried to figure out what I really loved.<br><br></p>

<p>A friend told me about DevBootcamp: he said that they were opening a Chicago campus and that they were really committed to growing the field. It was love at first sight. It only took about 30 seconds of him talking to me before I started reading up how to apply, how much it cost, when I could start, what past students have done since DevBootcamp, and what kind of instructors they had there. That friend is actually going to be starting DevBootcamp next month in San Francisco (hi, Allen). I did a ton of research on hacker schools and what it takes to be a junior developer, and settled on DevBootcamp.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

<p>When I applied, I spoke extensively with Dave about the lack of diversity in software development and I suddenly found myself telling him that I wanted to play a role in recruiting women into the field that I had come to love so quickly. I wasn&#39;t surprised that I was saying these things. It has been always been a huge thing for me, and my bad ass mom always encouraged me to stand up for people who weren&#39;t able to stand up for themselves. Give me a trail, I&#39;ll blaze it.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>Applying to DevBootcamp was the most terrifying thing I have ever done. I was telling the world what I wanted to do: I was going to be a programmer. What if I failed? What if I was only mediocre? What if I didn&#39;t get in?</strong><br><br></p>

<p>And then I got in. And now I&#39;m there. And I&#39;d like to think I&#39;ll be a bit better than mediocre someday. And everyday of it is magical and amazing. I have never been this tired in my entire life.<br><br></p>

<p>One of the best things about being in the second Chicago cohort is that I&#39;m helping to shape the culture in a very real way to make it a positive, safe, supportive, and enjoyable environment for <em>every</em> student that walks through the door. I was worried that DevBootcamp would be one of those places that&nbsp;<em>says</em>&nbsp;it values diversity, but doesn&#39;t really practice what they preach. I could not have been more wrong.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>DevBootcamp is the best hug I&#39;ve ever had, and the most learning I&#39;ve ever done.</strong><br><br></p>
