I spent a lot of time in phase 2 on an emotional roller coaster. I felt like a winner, a loser, a spaz, an imposter, a slacker, a bad ass, and a crazy person on a daily basis. Cycling through such intense emotions was exhausting. Was? Is. Still happening.

One thing that really changed for me during the last week of phase 2 when I FINALLY felt like I had formed a connection with the cohort below me. Part of me was resisting it because of a past bad experience, and the rest of me was too tired/split/overwhelmed. Regardless, that’s not a reason, it’s an excuse. I dragged myself off my ass and spent some time bonding with the Otters at the end of the second week in phase 2, and continued to check in with them through my third week as well.

It started small, with me asking “how are you?" and staying creepily silent while I waited for a more in depth answer than “fine." Some of them didn’t budge: fine was enough for them. But a few did budge, and having a one-on-one with them reminded me how important connection is to me.

This urge to connect was spurred by our Thursday speaker last week Greg Baugues, who spoke about developers and depression. He reminded me of the importance of connecting and talking.

Let’s talk. How are you?
