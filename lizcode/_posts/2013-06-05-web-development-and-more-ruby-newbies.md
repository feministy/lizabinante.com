The new cohort arrived on Monday. It’s all dudes. Now, when I say “dudes," I want you to know that I quite seriously mean dudes, not men. The majority of the new cohort are under 25, and many of them graduated college this year. I know that the dbc staff are trying as hard as they can to encourage diversity in the field and within the program. I also know that several factors out of their control contributed to the population of the new cohort (the Otters), but it’s still frustrating. My learning environment completely changed on Monday with the addition of 16 dudes. 
 
I went from being 1 of 3 women in a room of ~40 men to 1 of 5 women (two new female instructors!!!!!!! not enough exclamation points in the world) in a room of ~60 men. It’s like studying in a frat house full of competitive nerds.

One great thing is that there are now people “below" me that I can help learn. I love teaching and explaining things. It’s one of the big reasons I feel like I’m doing so well at dbc. Once I understand something, I can help someone else understand it also, which strengthens my ability to use it.

The downside? When you have a bunch of guys under 25 who just recently graduated college and a pretty woman is explaining technical concepts to them, they immediately go into “impress the lady" mode instead of learning and be willing to expose their ignorance. They ask for “help" to show me how clever they are: they want me to tell them that they are right rather than actually asking for help or an opinion. 

**When I offered help to two male students working on a complex regexp and called myself a regex wizard, a 3 minute debate ensued over whether or not I can call myself a wizard, or if I should call myself a witch.**

First: I can call myself whatever I want. It is 2013.

Second: really, guys? That’s where you went with it when I offered help? Gendered semantics and “that’s not how they do it in Harry Potter" instead of taking my offer seriously? I know they’ll take it seriously someday, and that asking for and receiving help are skills that not everyone has immediately… but wow. 

The big problem is that they haven’t learned the value of diverse voices yet. They will learn that at dbc, and if they don’t, they will be the ones missing out on the amazing wealth of knowledge that the folks here–students included–can provide.

Phase 2 started for me on Monday, and we jumped right into jQuery, AJAX, and Sinatra. It was a really overwhelming first day, not unlike our first day of phase 1. The main difference between day 1 of phase 1 and day 1 of phase 2 is really the amount of knowledge I have on the subject.

Before phase 1 started, I spent about 2 months learning Ruby basics and going over the prep work they sent to me. 

Before phase 2 started, I spent a weekend cramming as much information as I could into my brain.

Turns out you can’t learn as much in a weekend as you can in two months. Are you surprised? I’m not, but I was still shocked to find myself back in a panic zone of "OMG I DON’T KNOW ANYTHING OMG THIS IS AWFUL OMG OMG WHY AM I DOING THIS?!" 

I sat down Monday night, took a deep breath, and remembered that I’m not an expert. I’ll never be an expert. I’ll have a strong understanding, but I’ll always be learning new things about the stuff I know. I’m not here to try and become an expert, I’m here to develop a solid foundation that will help me on my road to becoming a developer. 

jQuery itself is not hard, and the concept of AJAX is not difficult, either. Combining the two and introducing Sinatra was a lot at once. In a good way. If I had learned them separately, it wouldn’t be as interesting or motivating. It also would not have been as rewarding because I wouldn’t have been able to compile such vibrant products right out of the gate. We built a Craigslist Junior yesterday! 

I am fortunate in that I have a strong background in CSS and HTML, so I am not struggling with those concepts and can spend less time learning about them. I am still learning new techniques and ways to manipulate my content, but it is not my main priority.
