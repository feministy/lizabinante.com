title: "A year ago today, I started doing this crazy thing that I love."

Since I became a co-leader for [Girl Develop It Chicago](http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-Chicago-IL/) in January, I introduce myself in much the same way at every workshop, class, and event. It goes a little something like this:

> Hi, my name is Liz, and I'm a co-leader for GDI Chicago along with Katy, say hi Katy! I'm currently a Software Engineer for an educational company called Instructure, but a year ago today, I wasn't doing this. I was quitting a decent paying job with no real career prospects to attend Dev Bootcamp, and now I'm an engineer and I absolutely love what I do. I am here to help you see if you love this as much as I do. I learned HTML and CSS when I was a kid so I could build a fan website for NSync - it's easy to learn, but hard to master, and you can totally do it! I love questions and I'm really nice, so you can email me anytime!

As of this weekend, I can no longer say "a year ago today" because I will have already quit that job and started working toward my goal of learning how to build software. I have been, in one form or another, working in web development for a year now.

It has not been without its ups and downs, but mostly it has been lots of *ups*. 

In the past year, I have:

* accomplished my goal of learning Ruby and Rails
* become significantly better with JavaScript than I thought I ever would be
* discovered an unbridled love of testing
* tackled home-grown MVC frameworks, Backbone, and Ember
* learned about building accessible applications
* actually built an accessible application
* started working as an engineer, [making a small contribution to education](https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms/commits/master?author=feministy)
* taught 4 Girl Develop It Classes
* organized 26 Girl Develop It events, classes, and workshops for our more than 1,000 members
* helped 105 women learn the basics of HTML and CSS through GDI classes
* guided 25 (soon to be 50!) women toward advancing their skills in HTML, CSS, and responsive design through GDI classes
* introduced 40 women to the basic concepts of web development
* dabbled with Clojure, Rust, and Go
* attended my first tech conference
* spoke at my first tech conference (thanks to Mike Moore and [Mountain West JavaScript](http://mtnwestjs.org/) for that!)
* learned how to manage a team of volunteers and instructors
* made wonderful new friends
* been trolled because sometimes I need to "seriously, shut the fuck up"
* been unrealistically happy
* felt challenged
* felt encouraged to do more, learn more, and be more

Plans for year 2? Year 5? Year 20? Already formed, and I can't wait to see where my ideas and goals take me. But, I have a pretty good idea that there won't be much snow wherever I end up following those goals and ideas.

The best part is that if I accomplished so much in the last year, I will be able to do so much more in the coming years now that I've gotten started. I want to get more scholarships for Girl Develop It students, learn more programming languages, speak at more conferences, write more Girl Develop It curriculum, guide more people toward a career in tech, improve my computer science knowledge, and get better at all of the things I already know. 

I want to take my career up, up, and away, and I want to be a real person who isn't *just an example* or a token, but a source of knowledge, advice, assistance, and (selfishly maybe) inspiration for women and minorities who want to transition to a technical career. I want to be a friendly light of optimism for people already in this field, reminding us why we all do what we do: because it makes us happy, and we love it.
