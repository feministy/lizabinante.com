## IRC

I personally use [IRCCloud](https://www.irccloud.com), which is free unless you want backlog ($5/mo).

IRCCloud will walk you through the basic setup of an account, including registering your nick on Freenode so no one else can take it from you. 

## Podcasts

On the whole, I recommend these podcasts without caveats about assholes, trigger warnings, and problematic language (although I have not listened to every episode). However, please note that there are some specific episodes that should be approached with caution.

## Code practice and review

While it does require a bit of a technical know-how to setup and install the command line interface for [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io), the exercises are top quality. Once you start submitting things, you'll be able to view other people's code as well and do what's call "nitpick", which means provide a review or comment on their code. 

If you're initimidated by nitpicking (I know I am!), I highly recommend you create an anonymized Github account (all account creation and authorization for Exercism is done through your Github account).
