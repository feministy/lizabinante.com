title:  "Thoughts on my first technical talk"

A week ago I gave my first technical talk. Since then, I've been ruminating on how it went and how it differed from my past human and social skill talks. I guess, really, if you're looking for a tl;dr, it would be: I didn't like it nearly as much and I don't know if I'll do it again.

Broadly, the talk covered building and re-architecting a front-end application that uses Angular and D3. The actual topic doesn't matter too much, but it was a topic that I was deeply interested in and very passionate about sharing with my audience. Perhaps that's where the differences between my past talks and this talk become most apparent: my audience. 

My audience was incredibly technical, with a very wide range of skill sets and interests. Unfortunately, most of them did not share an interest in front end development at all. Of the two single-session days of talks, each of which ranged from 15-20 minutes in length, only three covered front end development.
