    <h2 class="bright-alt">Hello! My name is Liz Abinante.</h2>

    <p>
      I like to make things. I knit, I write code, and I bake. I am a big fan of the Oxford comma. My super powers include knitting, designing, freakishly fast hand raising, speed-reading, and selecting perfectly ripe fruits and vegetables. I am also great at DIY crafts and braiding hair.

    <p>
      I'm passionate about diversity in engineering. I like to talk about what it means to be a minority in engineering. I love sharing my experiences with newcomers to programming, and enjoy the cycle of teaching and learning that is such a huge part of hacking.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gained my programming foundation at Dev Bootcamp, which I graduated from in July 2013. Currently, I am a Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.instructure.com/">Instructure</a>.

      I live in Chicago, originally hailing from the best coast (California, obviously).
